# Allow Players to Delete Their Tokens

Based on [Player Token Permissions Extended](https://github.com/VanceCole/player-token-permissions/), but simplified a lot.

- Lets players delete tokens they have selected by pressing the regular delete key
- At least 1 GM player must be connected
- A confirmation message will appear (unless you hold Shift)

(note:  unlike the original PTPE module, the token needs to be selected (not hovered/targeted), and
deleting tokens on other scenes is fine)

### Note - Foundry V10 might have a bug/feature that invalidates this module - see https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7765
