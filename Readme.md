# Allow Players to Delete Their Tokens

Based on [Player Token Permissions Extended](https://github.com/VanceCole/player-token-permissions/), but simplified a lot.

- Lets players delete tokens they have selected by pressing the regular delete key
- At least 1 GM player must be connected

(note:  unlike the original PTP module, the token needs to be selected (not hovered/targeted), and
deleting tokens on other scenes is fine)
